# strip-json-comments-loader for [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

The strip-json-comments-loader can be used in a Webpack configuration to remove javascript-style comments of the form ```/*...*/``` or ```//```. It is a wrapper of [strip-json-comments](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-json-comments).

## Install

`npm install strip-json-comments-loader webpack --save-dev`

## Usage

Though it was intended to allow comments in JSON definitions, it could be used in the pipeline of other cases where the javascript-style comments could not be mistaken for other symbols in the language, such as Css. Here is a web.config module doing so, for example:

``` javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        loaders: ["style", "css", "sass", "strip-json-comments-loader"]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```
